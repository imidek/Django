# Django
Basic project using Django framework. 
I have created a web application that allows users to save information of interest and add journal entries while learning about the topic. This is a project shown in the book " Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes. 

As it is only a test project and it doesn't contain any sensitive data, the Secrets have not been scraped.
